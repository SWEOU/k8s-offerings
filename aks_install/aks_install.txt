Azure Container Service (AKS) makes it simple to create, configure, and manage a cluster of virtual machines 
that are preconfigured to run containerized applications. This enables you to use your existing skills, or 
draw upon a large and growing body of community expertise, to deploy and manage container-based applications on Microsoft Azure.

By using AKS, you can take advantage of the enterprise-grade features of Azure, while still maintaining application 
portability through Kubernetes and the Docker image format.

Run the following CLI commands to deploy AKS. 

az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys


az aks install-cli

az aks get-credentials --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster


Verify the cluster is running by running the following command. 


kubectl get nodes

You should see something similar to the output shown below


jordan-nielsen:~ jordannielsen$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                       STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
aks-nodepool1-22349956-0   Ready     agent     12h       v1.7.9
